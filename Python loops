Types of Python Loops
for loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any other iterable object. It is ideal when you know the number of iterations beforehand.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)


while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified Boolean condition remains True. This loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a dynamic condition.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

Nested loops: Involves placing one loop inside another (e.g., a for loop inside a while loop, or a for loop inside another for loop). This is useful for working with multi-dimensional data structures like lists of lists.


adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
